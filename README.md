# Auto Outline


A Chrome extension to redirect all pages from a given domain (or domain regex) to outline.com. Useful for sites that have overwhelming clutter, or are not available due to GDPR or geographic restrictions.

This extension stores no data other than your own list of patterns. All it does is redirect matching urls to outline.com.
